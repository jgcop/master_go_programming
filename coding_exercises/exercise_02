Constant
How to solve these coding exercises:

Write your solution in Go Playground (https://play.golang.org) and then click on the Run button.

If your solution is not correct, then try to understand the error messages, rewrite the solution and press the Run button again. Repeat this step until you get the correct solution.

Each exercise should be solved in Go Playground in its own file. Save the URL of each file for future reference or recap.

Alternatively, you can write the solution in VSCode and run the program in terminal using: go run main.go



Coding Exercise #1

Using the const keyword declare and initialize the following constants:

1. daysWeek with value 7

2. lightSpeed with value 299792458

3. pi with value 3.14159

Run the program without errors.

Coding Exercise #3

 Calculate how many seconds are in a year.

 STEPS:

 1. Declare secPerDay constant and initialize it to the number of seconds in a day

 2. Declare daysYear constant and initialize it to 365

 3. Use fmt.Printf() to print out the total number of seconds in a year.

EXPECTED OUTPUT:

There are 31536000 seconds in a year.

Coding Exercise #4

There are an error in the following Go program. Try to identify the error, change the code and run the program without errors.

package main
 
func main() {
    const x int = 10
 
    // declaring a constant of type slice int ([]int)
    const m = []int{1: 3, 4: 5, 6: 8}
    _ = m
}

Coding Exercise #5

There are some errors in the following Go program. Try to identify the errors, change the code and run the program without errors.

package main
 
import "math"
 
func main() {
	const a int = 7
	const b float64 = 5.6
	const c = a * b
 
	x := 8
	const xc int = x
 
	const noIPv6 = math.Pow(2, 128)
}
