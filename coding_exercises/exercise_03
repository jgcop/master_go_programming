Package fmt
How to solve these coding exercises:

Write your solution in Go Playground (https://play.golang.org) and then click on the Run button.

If your solution is not correct, then try to understand the error messages, rewrite the solution and press the Run button again. Repeat this step until you get the correct solution.

Each exercise should be solved in Go Playground in its own file. Save the URL of each file for future reference or recap.

Alternatively, you can write the solution in VSCode and run the program in terminal using: go run main.go



Coding Exercise #1

Consider the following variable declarations: 

x, y, z := 10, 15.5, "Gophers"
score := []int{10, 20, 30}
Using fmt.Printf():

Print each variable using a specific verb for its type

Print the string value enclosed by double quotes ("Gophers")

Print each variable using the same verb

Print the type of y and score

Coding Exercise #3

There are some errors in the following Go program. Try to identify the errors, change the code and run the program without errors.

package main
 
import "fmt"
 
func main() {
	shape := "circle"
	radius := 3.2
	const pi float64 = 3.14159
	circumference := 2 * pi * radius
 
	fmt.Printf("Shape: %q\n")
	fmt.Printf("Circle's circumference with radius %d is %b\n", radius, circumference)
	_ = shape
}
